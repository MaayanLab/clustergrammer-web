grammer 7-14-2015
	I'm working on an app that allows a user to input a tsv separated matrix and obtain a clutergram visualization. I have a few bugs that need to be fixed so that the clustergram will work for small matrices. 

	Here's how to get into debug mode in javascript: 
  // debugger
  debugger;

To Do
	*. fix overflow on the left bug
	*. fix thin tiles bug
	4. determine if network formatting is incorreact and alert user rather than failing
	
Low priority 
	3. fix overflow from left side of column labels bug
	5. set color of the clustergram based on matrix data, black for positive data only, red/blue for up/dn data. 
	6. allow uploading excel files using python's excel uploading capabilities

	Avi recommended changes
		1. Suggests to rename it Clustogrammer instead of grammer
		2. Add options
			a. colors
			b. cluster by rows or columns only
			c. specify distance metric
			d. specify linkage type
		3. Allow users to manually swap the orders of the rows and columns
		4. Provide save functionality to SVG, EPS, PNG, PDF
		5. PRovide APIs that will submit the matrix to you as a JSON and they you will fire the app in a new winow or embedded in an existing page. 

	I'm going to implement the following changes, which are a combination of my own and Avi's changes. 

	To Do
		1. save data to mongodb, provide permanent link to user 
		1.1 provide export image capability, SVG, EPS, PNG, PDF
		2. add user login 
		3. add clustering/viz options (manual reordering)
		4. Provide API that GEO2Enrichr can comunitate with 
		5. add note taking capabilities 
		6. d3 viz changes
			1. add row and col labels into svg and have inputs for these
			2. fix zoom reset bug
			3. fix hover highlighting bug
			4. add row labeling triangles 
			5. remove global variables 
			6. set sizing to outside div
			7. clean up column label spillover on left side
			8. clean up variable height of tiles
			9. fix narrow tile bug 
			10. allow column search 
			11. improve row/column highlighting search 
			12. add triangles on row labels 
			13. add optional callback function for clicking on tile 
			14. get canvas version of the code working (will consist of one svg and one canvas)
			15. set up optional highlighting of tiles if there is evidence added
			16. set up optional highlighting of rows/cols if there is evidence 
			17. clean up how the matrix is made in d3_clustergram.js 
			18. resize matrix with current view 
			19. have variable domain/range controls
			20. automatically identify clusters and control cluster sizes using variable incosistency 
			21. add general ability to have bars on col and row titles 
			22. have two fold group identification, user supplied groups as well as automatically identified groups 
			23. add customizable major-row and major-col titles 


mongodb
	Qiaonan will send me the ip address for mongodb, the one hosted on one of our servers. I can then make a database within the mongodb, use robmongo for something(?) and then write to the database using Pymongo.
