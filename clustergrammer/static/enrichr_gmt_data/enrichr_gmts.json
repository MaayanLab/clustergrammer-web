Such experiments were conducted using various types of human cell lines types with antibodies targeting over 30 different histone modification marks. ChIP-seq datasets from the Roadmap Epigenomics project deposited to the GEO database were analyzed and converted to gene sets with the use of the software, SICER (PMID: 19505939). Previous studies (PMID: 19844228) have indicated that the use of control sample substantially reduces DNA shearing biases and sequencing artifacts; therefore, for each experiment, an input control sample was matched according to the description in GEO. ChIP-seq experiments without matched control input were not included. The resulting gene-set library contains 27 types of histone modifications for 64 human cell lines from various tissue origins.","publication":"PMID: 22690667","source":"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v1/url?u\u003dhttp://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/data\u0026k\u003dPFsgZv%2B4TEaU9fTpAWpLNw%3D%3D%0A\u0026r\u003dZnaf97SaF5%2BptCQJpmL8%2Bv8bxPr06%2F3ETKS7Ag5pqdY%3D%0A\u0026m\u003db6SIwZsd79lTEFUE%2FeNqh21s1lYiYjQ64sNBlrkx488%3D%0A\u0026s\u003d1fc5c34d3324a902849348411acfc93f8f1f7091803f18560132964bb01376c3","author":"Yan Kou","empty":true,"numTerms":0,"geneCoverage":0,"genesPerTerm":0.0},{"libraryId":205,"libraryName":"L1000_knockdown_knockdown","isFuzzy":false,"isRanked":false,"isActive":false,"displayOrder":1000000,"description":"The L1000 sig_summly tool computes consensus signatures of DE genes for perturbations across all conditions, and then ranks the similarity of consensus signatures for all pairs of perturbations (see link for more detail).
