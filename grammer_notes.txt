grammer 7-14-2015
	I'm working on an app that allows a user to input a tsv separated matrix and obtain a clutergram visualization. I have a few bugs that need to be fixed so that the clustergram will work for small matrices. 

	Here's how to get into debug mode in javascript: 
  // debugger
  debugger;

To Do
	*. fix overflow on the left bug
	*. fix thin tiles bug
	4. determine if network formatting is incorreact and alert user rather than failing
	
Low priority 
	3. fix overflow from left side of column labels bug
	5. set color of the clustergram based on matrix data, black for positive data only, red/blue for up/dn data. 
	6. allow uploading excel files using python's excel uploading capabilities

	Avi recommended changes
		1. Suggests to rename it Clustogrammer instead of grammer
		2. Add options
			a. colors
			b. cluster by rows or columns only
			c. specify distance metric
			d. specify linkage type
		3. Allow users to manually swap the orders of the rows and columns
		4. Provide save functionality to SVG, EPS, PNG, PDF
		5. PRovide APIs that will submit the matrix to you as a JSON and they you will fire the app in a new winow or embedded in an existing page. 

	I'm going to implement the following changes, which are a combination of my own and Avi's changes. 

	To Do
		1. save data to mongodb, provide permanent link to user 
		1.1 provide export image capability, SVG, EPS, PNG, PDF
		2. add user login 
		3. add clustering/viz options (manual reordering)
		4. Provide API that GEO2Enrichr can talk to 
		5. add note taking capabilities 

mongodb
	Qiaonan will send me the ip address for mongodb, the one hosted on one of our servers. I can then make a database within the mongodb, use robmongo for something(?) and then write to the database using Pymongo.
