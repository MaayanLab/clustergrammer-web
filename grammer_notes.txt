	I'm working on an app that allows a user to input a tsv separated matrix and obtain a clutergram visualization. I have a few bugs that need to be fixed so that the clustergram will work for small matrices. 

	Here's how to get into debug mode in javascript: 
  // debugger
  debugger;

To Do
	1. fix overflow on the left bug
	2. fix thin tiles bug
	3. fix overflow from left side of column labels bug
	4. determine if network formatting is incorreact and alert user rather than failing
	5. set color of the clustergram based on matrix data, black for positive data only, red/blue for up/dn data. 
	6. allow uploading excel files using python's excel uploading capabilities
